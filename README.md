oscmidi
=======

A bidirectionnal bridge between OSC and Midi.

When launched in parallel with Jack, OscMidi will appear in the ALSA tab of QJackCtl.

To compile oscmidi, in addition to 'normal' libraries, you need to have at least these installed:

Alsa library:
 - libasound2
 - libasound2-dev

Lightweight OSC:
 - liblo
 - liblo-dev

Then, to configure and build, just enter the following commands:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
make
sudo make install
